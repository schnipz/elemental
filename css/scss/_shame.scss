//  Notes:      The idea of '_shame.scss' is that you have a totally new 
//              stylesheet reserved just for your nasty, hacky, quick-fix CSS 
//              code. The code you have to write to get the release out on time, 
//              but the code that makes you ashamed.
//  
//              By putting your hacks and quick-fixes in their own file you do a 
//              few things:
//  
//               - You make them stick out like a sore thumb.
//               - You keep your 'main' codebase clean.
//               - You make developers aware that their hacks are made very 
//                 visible.
//               - You make them easier to isolate and fix.
//  
//              If anyone has to add a quick hack, they add it to here, this 
//              means that theyâ€™re putting their hacks out there in the open; it 
//              means that they are aware that what they're doing is hacky, it 
//              forces them to document what the problem was, how the hack fixes 
//              it, and how they might fix it for real given more time.
//  
//              It means that other developers can see what hacks are being 
//              introduced, and why; it means that all the hacky bits of CSS are 
//              self contained, and it creates a self-fulfilling todo list.
